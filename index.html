          <p>I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon.  I've been an artist since I first picked up a pencil and drew superheros beating the shit out of each other.  Fast forward through an adolescence filled with skateboarding, graffiti, rap music and being very, very high in math class, and I had all the ingredients necessary for the next decade of making music, working at a coffee shop and having constant existential crises (aka my twenties.)  I began to find my own path through the world as a sensitive-artist-type by developing self care and artistic and spiritual community, and as thirty year old wise idiot I have found it is time to leave my coccoon of service industry jobs and bloom into the creative field as a web developer, designer, musician and whatever the hell else I want to be.  <span>The bananas are just a random element I used to demonstrate float properties.  They add nothing to this web site or the world at large.  Furthermore, this text looks different only because I needed to demonstrate the span element for this project.</span></p>
